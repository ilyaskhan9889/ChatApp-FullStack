TanStack Query (previously called React Query) is a data-fetching and state management 
library for React (and other frameworks).

It helps you handle server state (data that lives on a server, like API responses 
from REST or GraphQL) in your React app.

ðŸ”‘ Why it exists

In React, managing async data from an API is tricky:

You usually need useState + useEffect + fetch/axios.

You also have to manually handle loading, error, refetching, caching, etc.

If the same data is needed in multiple components, you either refetch unnecessarily or 
create a global state solution.

TanStack Query solves this by handling all of that for you.


1-useQuery â†’ Read data (GET)

2-useMutation â†’ Write / change data (POST, PUT, DELETE)
In TanStack Query, useMutation is a hook used for modifying data on the server
(e.g., POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests).
